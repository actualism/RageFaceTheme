README for RageFaceTheme
----------------------------------------

There is no warranty for this software. I just made it because I was bored. You're on your own. 

To alter the theme:
 1) Make the changes in the "troll" directory (which is the source directory for the pidgin theme)
 2) That's it, you're done!

To generate the archives, php, and xml:
 1) Run the powershell script "Generate archives.ps1".
 2) The two archives are created in tar.gz files, as well as the xml and php files (in the xml and php folders).

Prerequisites:
 - Powershell
 - Powershell community extension (http://pscx.codeplex.com/)
 - A sense of hilarity
