Changes:
 - Added the :sad and :wat faces
 - Updated all filenames for the faces to be lowercase (should improve compatibility on linux)
 - Ensured all face files were in the colloquy package
 
Notes:
 - You may have to clear your install directory before installing this update, or the new lowercase filenames may not appear (I only tested this in Windows).
